Building on years of experience hacking devices from brands like Roborock and Xiaomi, the presenters dive into the alarming security issues within Ecovacs robots, the market leader in home robotics. The talk covers the difficulties of reporting bugs to the company and warns against relying on third-party certifications. It emphasizes the importance of being cautious with device choices and even personal relationships, due to the potential privacy risks involved. | 24-08-2024 |
| | [iRobot‚Äôs Roomba J7 series robot vacuum](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/) | N/A | Personal pictures in a home environment were found in the Internet taken by an iRobot‚Äôs Roomba J7 series robot vacuum. The photos vary in type and in sensitivity. The most intimate image we saw was the series of video stills featuring the young woman on the toilet, her face blocked in the lead image but unobscured in the grainy scroll of shots below. In another image, a boy who appears to be eight or nine years old, and whose face is clearly visible, is sprawled on his stomach across a hallway floor. A triangular flop of hair spills across his forehead as he stares, with apparent amusement, at the object recording him from just below eye level. Various other home pictures that tag objects in the environment were found. | 19-19-2022 |
|  | Unitree's [Go1](https://m.unitree.com/products/go1) | d0tslash (MAVProxyUser in GitHub) | A hacker found a kill switch for a gun‚Äìwielding legged robot[^19][^20][^21][^22]. The hack itself leverages a kill switch functionality/technology that ships in all units of the robot and that listens for a particular signal at 433Mhz. When it hears the signal, the robot shuts down. d0tslash used a portable multi-tool for pentesters ([Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/)) to emulate the shutdown, copying the signal the robot dog‚Äôs remote broadcasts over the 433MHz frequency. | 09-08-2022 |
| | Enabot's [`Ebo Air`](https://na.enabot.com/shop/air001) | **Modux**[^1] |  Researchers from Modux found a security *flaw* in Enabot Ebo Air #robot and responsibly disclosed their findings. Attack vectors could lead to remote-controlled *robot* spy units. Major entry point appears to be a hardcoded system administrator password that is weak and shared across all of these robots. Researchers also found information disclosure issues that could lead attackers to exfiltrate home (e.g. home WiFi password) that could then be used to pivot into other devices through local network. | 21-07-2022 |
| <ins>Analyzing the Data Distribution Service (DDS) Protocol for Critical Industries</ins>[^6] | [`ROS 2`](https://ros.org), [eProsima](https://www.eprosima.com/)'s [`Fast-DDS`](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS), [OCI](https://objectcomputing.com/)'s [`OpenDDS`](https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS), [ADLINK](https://www.adlinktech.com/)'s (*now [ZettaScale](https://www.zettascale.tech/)'s*) [CycloneDDS](https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds), [RTI](<https://www.rti.com>)'s [ConnextDDS](https://www.rti.com/products), [Gurum Networks](https://www.gurum.cc/home)'s [GurumDDS](https://www.gurum.cc/freetrial) and [Twin Oaks Computing](http://www.twinoakscomputing.com/)'s [CoreDX DDS](http://www.twinoakscomputing.com/coredx/download) | [Ta-Lun Yen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evsfy/), [Federico Maggi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phretor/), [V√≠ctor Mayoral-Vilches](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmayoral/), [Erik Boasson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-boasson-21344912/) *et al.* (**various**)[^6] | This research looked at the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) standards and its implementations from a security angle. 12 CVE IDs were discovered üÜò, 1 specification-level vulnerability identified üíª, and 6 DDS implementations were analyzed (3 open source, 3 proprietary). Results hinted that DDS's security mechanisms were not secure and much effort on this side was required to protect sensitive industrial and military systems powered by this communication middleware. The research group detected that these security issues were present in almost 650 different devices exposed on the Internet, across 34 countries and affecting 100 organizations through 89 Internet Service Providers (ISPs). | 19-04-2022 |
| <ins>Hacking ROS 2, the Robot Operating System</ins>[^16] | [`ROS 2`](https://ros.org) | [V√≠ctor Mayoral-Vilches](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vmayoral/) *et al.* (**various**)[^16][^17] |  A team of security researchers led by the spanish firm Alias Robotics on their robotics focus discovered various security vulnerabilities that led to compromising the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) through its underlying communication middleware (the DDS communications middleware). Researchers demonstrated how to dissect ROS 2 communications and perform ROS 2 reconnaissance, ROS 2 network denial of service through reflection attacks, and ROS 2 (Node) crashing by exploiting memory overflows which could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code. To mitigate these security vulnerabilities, Alias Robotics contributed to various open source tools including to SROS2[^17] with a series of developer tool extensions that help detect some of these insecurities in ROS 2 and DDS. ROS 2 *community-owner* Open Robotics did not follow up with these results or contributions and disregarded overall its relevance, pushing security responsibility aside[^18]| 22-04-2022 |
| <ins>JekyllBot:5</ins>[^7] | Aethon TUG smart robots ([various](https://aethon.com/products/)) | **Cynerio**[^7] | JekyllBot:5 is a collection of five critical zero-day vulnerabilities that enable remote control of Aethon TUG smart autonomous mobile robots and their online console, devices that are increasingly used for deliveries in global hospitals.

Security researchers showed how teardown can help understanding the underlying hardware for uncovering security vulnerabilities. The group showed how robot teardown helped uncover more than 100 security flaws with 17 new CVE IDs granted over a period of two years. The group also demonstrated how various robot manufacturers are employing various planned obsolescense practices and how through teardown, planned obsolescence hardware limitations can be identified and bypassed obtaining full control of the hardware and giving it back to users, which poses both an opportunity to claim the *right to repair* as well as a threat to various robot manufacturers‚Äô business models | 20-07-2021|
